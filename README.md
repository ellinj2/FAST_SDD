# FAST Final Assessment Scheduling Technologies
## Dynamic schedules for dynamic situations

Manually generating schedules to avoid conflicts with a large number of events is daunting, and can often be unwieldy. However, a computer can tackle such a problem in relatively little time, running through thousands of potential schedules in a day. A software like this can save companies tons of time and expenses while leaving employees open for more important tasks. Having schedules more readily available also benefits those who rely on them, giving them calendar structure well in advance of an event.


### Environment Setup
1. Install Python 3.6 or later (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Extract the contents of FAST.zip to the desired directory
3. In a command line (e.g. CMD, Hyper, Bash, etc.), navigate to that directory
4. Create a virtual environment (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
5. Activate the virtual environment (run “.\{environment_name}\Scripts\activate”)
6. Run “pip install -r requirements.txt” or “conda install --file requirements.txt”

### Launch Website
1. In the directory that you extracted FAST.zip to, run “python3 app.py”
2. The terminal will display a URL where the website is hosted (e.g. “127.0.0.1:5000”). In a web browser, navigate to this URL
